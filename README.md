# BlazorStatic.Templates

Templates for `dotnet new`

## Long time no see actions - aka how it works

- When BlazorStatic new version is creater one has to run the manual action that will build itself, test a little bit and eventually push to nuget
- Every day the second action runs to refresh BlazorStatic.MinimalBlog with whatever change might happen here. Just check it's not dead.
